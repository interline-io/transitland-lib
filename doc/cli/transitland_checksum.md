## transitland checksum

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a static GTFS feed's contents

### Synopsis

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a static GTFS feed's contents

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a GTFS feed archive and provide a link to look for a matching feed version in Transitland's online archive.

This checksum uniquely identifies the feed version and is used by Transitland to detect when new feed versions are available. The SHA1 is calculated from the contents of the feed archive, not the zip archive as a whole, so it won't change if only the zip packaging changes.

Example:
  transitland checksum myfeed.zip
  transitland checksum --raw http://example.com/myfeed.zip  # Output only the SHA1 hash

This command is useful for verifying feed integrity and looking up feed versions on Transitland. Use --raw for scripting scenarios where only the hash is needed.

```
transitland checksum <feed-path> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for checksum
      --raw    Output only the SHA1 hash (useful for scripting)
```
