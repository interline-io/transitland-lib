## transitland checksum

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a static GTFS feed

### Synopsis

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a static GTFS feed

Calculate the SHA1 checksum of a GTFS feed archive and provide a link to look for a matching feed version in Transitland's online archive.

This checksum uniquely identifies the feed version and is used by Transitland to detect when new feed versions are available. By default, this command shows both the zip SHA1 (archive file) and the directory SHA1 (feed contents). 

The directory SHA1 is calculated by:
- Finding all lowercase .txt files in the main directory (agency.txt, stops.txt, routes.txt, etc.)
- Sorting them alphabetically by filename
- Concatenating their contents in sorted order
- Calculating the SHA1 hash of the concatenated data

This approach ensures the hash represents the actual transit data, not the packaging, so it won't change if only the zip compression, file ordering, or metadata changes.

Example:
  transitland checksum myfeed.zip
  transitland checksum --raw-dir-sha1 http://example.com/myfeed.zip  # Output only the directory SHA1 hash, which is used for comparison in Transitland fetch process
  transitland checksum --raw-zip-sha1 myfeed.zip  # Output only the zip SHA1 hash, which is used as an identifier in public Transitland APIs

This command is useful for verifying feed integrity and looking up feed versions on Transitland. Use --raw-dir-sha1 or --raw-zip-sha1 for scripting scenarios where only a specific hash is needed.

```
transitland checksum <feed-path> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help           help for checksum
      --raw-dir-sha1   Output only the directory SHA1 hash
      --raw-zip-sha1   Output only the zip SHA1 hash
```
