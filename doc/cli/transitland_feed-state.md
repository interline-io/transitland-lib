## transitland feed-state

Manage feed state and materialized tables

### Synopsis

Manage feed state and materialized tables

This command manages feed state including which feed versions are active, and maintains materialized tables that cache active route, stop, and agency data for improved query performance. It provides centralized control over feed version activation across the entire system.
